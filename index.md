# Stuff I learn and find cool enough to share.
## About me
As a Ph.D. candidate in Cybersecurity at the University of Central Florida, my focus has been on advancing the field through rigorous kernel security research. Engaging in complex security problem-solving, my academic work synergizes with my engineering background multifaceted cyber challenges.

Our team's commitment to enhancing cybersecurity is evident through consistent efforts in configuration-aware kernel fuzz testing, leading to notable improvements in bug detection. With a strong foundation in ethical hacking and a track record of identifying critical vulnerabilities, the goal remains to contribute meaningfully to the security community and share insights with both peers and aspiring professionals in the evolving landscape of cyber threats.
